## Project Goal ##
Our goal is to create an open source tool, which will allow users to analyse all sorts of data using techniques of machine learning. We are not restricted to financial-only data, nor even to time series, though provisions have been made to allow working with this kind of data as well. Set of available algorithms is only restricted by our knowledge ant time.

## How can I help? ##
We will be glad to receive any help from the community, whether you just want to write a patch once or want to contribute on a regular basis.

  * Programmers - people, we need you! I'd love to implement way more features, but I don't have time for it. I need your help. If you have something specific in mind - good. If not - sure we will find something for you.

  * UI Designers - for a project to be sucesful it needs to be very user friendly. So if you're an expert in UI design, you're more than welcome to help, either by giving your suggections, or probably even doing the actual design!

  * Users - yes, you can alos help us, by providing your feedback, ideas, and reporting issues (http://code.google.com/p/dolphin-da/issues/list)!

## Features ##
Dolphin Data Analyser currently contains implementations of following algorithms:

  * Neural Networks
    * Back Prpagation
    * Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG)
  * Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Kernel Agregating Algorith Regression (KAAR)
    * KAARCh
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM) - coming soon

## System Requirements ##
Dolphin DA is writen using .NET2 and should run on any windows platform. Some algorithms might be extremely CPU or RAM consuming, thus it is strongly advisable to have at leat 512 MB Ram and a 2 GHz CPU machine.
